## University of California, Berkeley
### August 2020 to present

Since October of 2020, I have been a member of Dr. Richmond Sarpong's group, which focuses on completing the syntheses of complex natural products and inventing new chemical methodologies to the same end.
We also have interests in selective functionalization and computational chemistry as members of the national organizations CCHF (Center for C–H Functionalization) and CCAS (Center for Computer-Assisted Synthesis), respectively.
*For the purposes of retaining our group's intellectual property, this description is necessarily sparse.*

My work focuses on enhancing the applicability and enantioselectivity of certain halogenation methods by taking advantage of key intramolecular binding phenomena. 
I also focus on enabling more complex chemical transformations facilitated by enantioselective halonium delivery to simpler substrates.

## The George Washington University
### 2016 – 2020

**Malaria and Tuberculosis, Dxr**
As an undergraduate, I worked in Dr. Cynthia Dowd's group, which investigates natural product derivatives as antimalarial and antituberculotic agents. 
Malaria and tuberculosis are deadly, global diseases caused by the pathogens plasmodium falciparum (*pf*) and mycobacterium tuberculosis (*mtb*), respectively. 
Pan-drug resistance emergence and common HIV coinfections highlight the necessity of continued therapeutic development. 
The primary pharmacological targets of current antibiotics are metabolic enzymes, which *mtb* and *pf* rely on heavily for various bioprocesses. 
Fueled by the declining efficacy of current drugs as resistant *pf* and *mtb* strains emerge, we sought to investigate a series of compounds that target a key pathogenic metabolic enzyme, Dxr (1-Deoxy-D-Xylulose-5-phosphate Reductoisomerase). 
Dxr catalyzes the rate-limiting in the methyl erythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which generates many important biomolecules. 
Its necessity and absence from the human genome highlight Dxr as a key inhibition target to combat these diseases.

**Fosmidomycin, Bisubstrate Inhibition**
Central to this approach is fosmidomycin, a bacterially isolated compound that binds to Dxr but faces pharmacokinetic challenges, such as cell permeability. 
Aiming to improve upon the poor metabolic properties of fosmidomycin and to take advantage of additional binding interactions in the active and cofactor sites of Dxr, I prepared a series of ɑ-β unsaturated, *N*-benzoylated derivatives of this natural product. 
Early efforts showed the trans unsaturation of the linking carbon chain to improve drug activity likely due to a decrease in compound flexibility.	  
Seeking to probe Dxr's cofactor site, my project began by exploring a broad range of N-benzoyl substitution patterns. 
Funded by GW's A.D. Britt Fellowship and equipped with early biological data, I synthesized (see above) a series of 32 compounds to establish early SAR, which achieved considerable potency against *pf*. 
I also worked to incorporate a metathetic coupling approach into our linear synthesis.  
Supported by the Goldwater scholarship, I continued working to expand the breadth of SAR for the compound series my project afforded while exploring "pro-drug" derivatives of the most active, 
where metabolically unfavorable molecular moieties are masked to be endogenously converted in vivo to the active compound. 
Lipophilic BOM (Benzoyl-Oxy-Methylene) and POM (Pivaloyl-Oxy-Methylene) groups are coupled to the phosphonate region, masking the detrimental effects its polarity has on the compounds' cell permeability and metabolic resilience. 
Guided by the context of ongoing biological evaluation, this series continues to expand along with our understanding of the structure-activity relationships of these compounds.

## Vertex Pharmacueticals, Inc.
### 2019, 2020

I worked with Vertex Pharmaceuticals over the summer of 2019 as a chemical development intern under Dr. Stefanie Roeper, a senior scientist in their process chemistry department. 
I focused largely on devising routes to afford novel therapeutics bearing indole skeletons, a structure commonplace in many biologically important molecules. 
Much work has been done towards developing synthetic strategies to prepare molecules bearing indole skeletons, many of which are of significant pharmaceutical relevance. 
Avoiding the pitfalls of previous approaches, I worked to develop a versatile and efficient route for poly-substituted indoles and cyclized indazoles to solve contemporary illnesses. 
My final route utilized new iterations of the Buchwald-Hartwig amination followed by an optimized, mild, one-pot Fischer cyclization while allowing dynamic control over the substitution patterns of the final product. 
Furthermore, my route impacted the development of a phase I active pharmaceutical ingredient.

Recognizing the value of rigorously implementing contemporary chemical tools to access complex, medically pertinent molecules, I was fortunate to be invited back to Vertex Pharmaceutical's chemical development department to work with Dr. David Stephens and Dr. Rebecca Swett on computational projects during the summer of 2020.
We sought to mechanistically understand a key synthetic step in the preparation of a stage three active pharmaceutical ingredient for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
Principally, this work focused on elucidating transition state geometries and potential energy surface to identify off-cycle pathways and provide insight as to how to expand the chemistry beyond one substrate. 
Working interdepartmentally with chemical and biological informatics teams, I employed machine learning with Python scripts to elucidate catalytic activities, electronic structures, and other quantum mechanical parameters that describe this chemical reaction in order to improve its efficiency, sustainability, and applicability to other projects. 
Expanding beyond the usual disciplinary boundaries in this industrial setting broadened my interests to apply computer science to synthesis using *ab initio* methods to study chemical and biochemical phenomena and technologies, assets that have proved valuable in my academic projects.
