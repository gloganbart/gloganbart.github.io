The following are some evaluations from previous students. Please click to view!

  <summary>Organic Chemistry Testimonial I</summary>
  
  Logan obviously had a tremendous understanding of the material and, as a result, was able to answer any question we had clearly and thoroughly. Often times, he would address concepts that, while not explicitly discussed in the procedure or background reading, were relevant to the lab, which helped to explain any subtleties we noticed. Outside lab, he demonstrated similar helpfulness and clarity in office hours. His lab lectures were well organized and explained both the chemistry and lab procedures in each experiment.

Logan B. is by far the greatest GSI I've had so far at college. He excels in every attribute that I would deem vital for a GSI. He is knowledgable, helpful, and his Office Hours are legendary. The only mistake I made is not going to his Office Hours earlier. The understanding and patience he exuded to even the most mundane questions I asked were fabulous.

  <summary>Organic Chemistry Testimonial III</summary>
  
Logan is the best GSI I've ever had due to his preparation, ability to explain complex ideas, and most of all, patience with students. He genuinely explained things better than the professor and was willing to explain things over and over until students understood it. He was also very easy to talk to and made online lab more enjoyable than I ever thought it would be. He is the only reason I am going to pass this class.
