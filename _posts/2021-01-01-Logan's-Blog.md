I'm (George) Logan Bartholomew, a graduate student in the UC Berkeley department of chemistry working on fun new ways to make fun new things in the [Sarpong group](https://www.sarponggroup.com/). This is a repository inclusive of projects, teaching materials, work and research descriptions, contact and resumé information, and more. Welcome! [^1]
